# Synthetic-Data-Toolkit

**Toolkit for generating synthetic data using GANs, advanced sampling techniques, and temperature scaling.**  
This repository provides tools and scripts for generating synthetic data, including text and embeddings, using cutting-edge techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), nucleus sampling, and temperature scaling.

## Features
- **GAN-based synthetic data generation**: Customizable scripts for generating realistic synthetic data.
- **Advanced sampling techniques**: Nucleus sampling and temperature scaling for probabilistic text generation.
- **Sample data and embeddings**: Pre-generated synthetic datasets for experimentation.
- **Well-documented notebooks**: Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks for easy understanding and implementation.

## Contents
- `GANs_synthetic.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing GANs for synthetic text generation.
- `synthetic.ipynb`: Script demonstrating synthetic data generation workflows.
- `synthetic_data.csv`: Example synthetic data generated using the toolkit.
- `synthetic_texts_and_embeddings.json`: Pre-sampled synthetic texts and embeddings for reference.

## Getting Started
